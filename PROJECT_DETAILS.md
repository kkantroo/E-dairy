# 📘 Online Work Diary Maintenance System

> A role-based web application that digitizes the traditional staff work diary system, allowing staff to submit daily work entries, HODs to approve them, and administrators to manage and monitor records efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Replace the **manual staff work diary system** (physical registers) with a **secure, structured, and digital solution** for colleges, universities, schools, and educational institutions.

### Problems Solved

| Manual System Problem        | Digital Solution                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Staff write work in registers| Data stored in MongoDB database   |
| Hard to track workload       | Automated workload tracking       |
| Difficult to generate reports| Automatic report generation       |
| Risk of data loss            | Persistent cloud-based storage    |
| Time-consuming approvals     | Automated approval workflow       |
